This is a repo designed to speed up RL analysis by providing a custom lightweight way to record episodes during training
and evaluate them graphically. To use, wrap a gym or gymnasium environment in a structuredDataWrapper which will save
episodes to a folder during training and evaluation. Next use the custom pyqt GUI in the analysis folder to visualize
your data. With this gui you can compare data over a single run, across multiple runs and more. Additionally, you can
add plotting functions that you often use to custom buttons and save that config in the saved_configs folder.

We have added an example saved config for the half-cheetah enviroment.

Currently available:
Analysis gui for single episode plotting
Gymnasium environment wrapper to allow for easy episode saving

Upcoming:
Updates to gui to allow for folder wide plotting
Updates to gui to allow user to add buttons for commonly used plots
Configs for more commonly used gymnasium environments
